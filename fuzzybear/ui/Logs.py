'''devnotes

- NOTE - 

+ Want logs to have a format similar to the following

[0:00] Running Fuzzer against <json1>, input corpus <json1.txt>

+ Potentially have a few defined log formats for example:
      + startup log - take in target and corups
      + event log - take in event type and message
      + error log - take in error type and message
      + debug log - take in debug message

+ Each log type will have associated colour

+ Since the UI is re-rendered on each update will need
  to be able to support a system which maintains a list
  of the last x logs (that fit on the UI) and be able
  to return a renderable of those logs
